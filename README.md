# Ayumi Hamasaki Scans (1993 - Present)

This repository's aim is to archive Ayumi Hamasaki's scans from her early days (1993 or so) to present day. 

For now, only magazines scans are available, but more might be added later (calendars, TA magazines, photobooks,...)

Warning :
- So far I have a few Vivi Deji Deji Diary entries missing or the scans I found are too small-sized (2012-2013 years)
- Some of the scans of the Vivi June 2017 issue have an ugly watermark in the middle of them (not all, just some)
